# v-Hotmap adapted algorithm
## The detection of volcanic activity based on thermal reflection derived from Sentinel-2

The repository includes the code of modified v-Hotmap algorithm to detect hotspots.
The developed script is now working with a series of volcanoes, in a future it will be adapted to include more objects.
The tool is useful for detection and tracng of volcanic activity.
