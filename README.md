# V-Hotmap adapted application
## The detection of thermal hostspots associated with volcanic activity based on thermal reflection derived from Sentinel-2

The repository includes the code of modified v-Hotmap algorithm to detect hotspots. It is based on the paper of Murphy et al., 2016
Sam W. Murphy, Carlos Roberto de Souza Filho, Rob Wright, Giovanni Sabatino, Rosa Correa Pabon,

The main changes are:

---
The developed tool is now applicable to the following volcanoes:
- Kilauea
- Nyiragongo 
- Nyamuragira Erta Ale
- Villarrica 
- Yasur 
- Stromboli
- Etna
In the further version the list of volcanoes will be broaden.

### How to use?
1. The tool could be used in 2 ways: ==on your local server== and through the ==binder deployed application==. I strongly advise to choose the second option.
If you still want to use it on your local computer in the file 'requerements.txt' all used Python packages with their versions that should be installed in your python environment, the 'runtime.txt' contains the used version of Python.
2. In Binder application all packages are already installed and all data could be retrieved online.
